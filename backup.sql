What about boxing and unboxing , boxing is conversion of the one primitive type to its corresponding reference type (int to Integer in this situation) while unboxing is conversion of the reference type to corresponding primitive type.You can think of actually \"boxing\" the varaible and putting it to heap side , and unboxing as reverse procedure to the stack side.  These boxing and unboxing operations are automatically done by java while using generics.Generics&nbsp; can think of as a compile time check for class or interface or any other types that used with generics for their parameters.From definition its hard to understand so lets show a example of generics use.</p>\r\n<pre lang=\"java\">List&lt;Integer&gt; ints = new ArrayList&lt;Integer&gt;();\r\nints.add(1);\r\nint n = ints.get(0);</pre>\r\n<p>Here as you can see we are creating a list from arraylist(which is a class the implements list interface so assigment is OK) with specified parameters String in angle brackets.With the help of generics it is guaranteed that all the parameters that added to arraylist is String , if you try to add something other that String it is a compile time error.Before java generics its programmer job to guess what is the variable type coming from list and make suitable cast to that object.It is a extra work for programmer.With generics its is now compiler responsibility to check parameters and give compile time error.  You can say it is not different from c++ templates , but actually it does.There is a different implementation of the generics in bot c++ and java side.In C++ if you use generics and create and objects lets say List&lt;String&gt; and List&lt;Integer&gt; and List&lt;List&lt;String&gt;&gt; , C++ made 3 copy of your code for each generic in use.If you use 100 different type of generics there will be 100 different code , this can lead to code bloat.But in java no matter how many differnt generics you use there is only one code for all.C++ model generics called expansion,it can be lead to code bloat but in performance side it is more efficient that Java model.Also if you are using generics with C++ you have to be careful about usage of angle brackets.

All it means is Java for small devices. Small devices range in size from pagers, mobile phones, and personal digital assistants (PDAs) all the way up to things like set-top boxes.  J2ME is divided into <strong>configurations, profiles, and optional APIs</strong>, which provide specific information about APIs and different families of devices. A configuration is designed for a specific kind of device based on memory constraints and processor power. It specifies a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) that can be easily ported to devices supporting the configuration. It also specifies a strict subset of the <strong>Java 2 Platform, Standard Edition (J2SE) API</strong>s that will be used on the platform, as well as additional APIs that may be necessary. Device manufacturers are responsible for porting a specific configuration to their devices.</p>\r\n<p><h3>What is profiles?</h3></p>\r\n<p>Profiles are more specific than configurations. A profile is based on a configuration and provides additional APIs, such as user interface, persistent storage, and whatever else is necessary to develop running applications for the device.  Optional APIs define specific additional functionality that may be included in a particular configuration (or profile). The whole caboodle&mdash;configuration, profile, and optional APIs&mdash; that is implemented on a device is called a stack. For example, a possible future device stack might be CLDC/MIDP + Mobile Media API. See the section &ldquo;Platform Standardization&rdquo; later in this chapter for information on JSR 185, which defines a standard J2ME stack.  J2ME configuration divided into 2 categories according to device specifications.First one is <strong>Connected Device Configuration</strong> called CDC which sits on top of the J2ME.These devices have to meet the requirements specified by JSR community process.CDC devices target especially high end PDA\'s , navigation systems , settop boxes.Therse devices has ,at a minimum, 512KB of read-only memory (ROM), 256KB of random access memory (RAM), and some kind of network connection.And also CDC devices gives full JVM support.  Other type of configuration is <strong>Connected Limited Device Configuration</strong> which is called CLDC.This configuration category include devices like mobile phones,pagers,PDA\'s...As you see these devices smaller than the devices listed on CDC.CDC devices have limited memory , limited processor power ,limited screen size,limited battery life because of these developing applications for these devices is a important process.The CLDC is designed for devices with 160KB to 512KB of total memory, including a minimum of 160KB of ROM and 32KB of RAM available for the Java platform.For note connected means here network connection that is not very fast and intermitted.These devices support specific implementation of JVM which is KVM.K means here as far as i know \"it is a JVM whose size is measured in kilobytes rather than megabytes\".  Other important part of J2ME is profiles.I am not going to dive into other profiles just MIDP which is the important and known one &nbsp;in J2ME development.MIDP stands for Mobile Information Device Profile and have also JSR process and specifications.Here is the MIDP 2.0 specifications.</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>A minimum of 256KB of ROM for the MIDP implementation (this is in addition to the requirements of the CLDC)</li>\r\n<li>A minimum of 128KB of RAM for the Java runtime heap</li>\r\n<li> A minimum of 8KB of nonvolatile writable memory for persistent data</li>\r\n<li> A screen of at least 96&times;54 pixels &bull;	Some capacity for input, either by keypad, keyboard, or touch screen</li>\r\n<li> Two-way network connection, possibly intermittent</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p><em>Most of the latest devices support MIDP 2.0 specification but older ones user MIDP 1.0.</em> <strong>Structure of MIDP Application</strong> <strong> </strong>MIDP application has a API which comes from both CLDC and also MIDP 2.0 .CLCD api comes from core api defined in Java SE and MIDP api comes with java micro edition packages.Here is a list of avaliable packages.  For CLDC</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>java.lang</li>\r\n<li>java.lang.ref</li>\r\n<li>java.io</li>\r\n<li>java.util</li>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.io</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>For MIDP</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.lcdui</li>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.lcdui.game</li>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.media</li>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.media.control</li>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.midlet</li>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.pki</li>\r\n<li>javax.microedition.rms</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>Also device vendors supply their own API\'s specific to their device.These are different API\'s from MIDP and as i said specific to that device not platform independent and make developers to reach device specific features.MIDP applications sits on top of the device specific OS , and use only api provided by MIDP and CLDC.Device specific java application use API provided by device vendor.(Device Specific API\'s).  <strong>Advantages of MIDP</strong> Portability  The advantage of using Java over using other tools for small device application development is portability. You could write device applications with C or C++, but the result would be specific to a single platform. An application written using the MIDP APIs will be directly portable to any MIDP device.  Security  A second compelling reason for using Java for small device development is security. Java is well known for its ability to safely run downloaded code like applets.

For CLDC</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>java.lang</li>\n<li>java.lang.ref</li>\n<li>java.io</li>\n<li>java.util</li>\n<li>javax.microedition.io</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>For MIDP</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>javax.microedition.lcdui</li>\n<li>javax.microedition.lcdui.game</li>\n<li>javax.microedition.media</li>\n<li>javax.microedition.media.control</li>\n<li>javax.microedition.midlet</li>\n<li>javax.microedition.pki</li>\n<li>javax.microedition.rms</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Also device vendors supply their own API\'s specific to their device.These are different API\'s from MIDP and as i said specific to that device not platform independent and make developers to reach device specific features.MIDP applications sits on top of the device specific OS , and use only api provided by MIDP and CLDC.Device specific java application use API provided by device vendor.(Device Specific API\'s).  <strong>Advantages of MIDP</strong> Portability  The advantage of using Java over using other tools for small device application development is portability. You could write device applications with C or C++, but the result would be specific to a single platform. An application written using the MIDP APIs will be directly portable to any MIDP device.  Security  A second compelling reason for using Java for small device development is security. Java is well known for its ability to safely run downloaded code like applets. This is a perfect fit&mdash;it&rsquo;s easy to imagine nifty applications dynamically downloading to your mobile phone.</p>','2011-10-05 23:26:08','2011-10-05 23:26:08'),(10,1,'java-quirk-label-plus-line-comment','Java Quirk | Label plus Line Comment','<p>Last day while writing some java code sample i accidently paste and http link into main method , normally this must give me error from compiler but it didnt gave any error , than i realize whats going on</p>\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270004.js?file=StrangeJava\"></script>\r\n<p>The trick here is that http: means that programmer defining a new label that jump the program execution to that label and two slashed follow as you may know one line comment .

Lets try to implement this transition this is not built into Android SDK i try to implement this behaviour with source code given below.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270016.js?file=EndlessScrollActivity\"></script>\n\n<p>We have to implement onScrollListener in order to implement endless scroll effect than do all the logic inside the onScroll method of the activity. Lets say we have 30 item in list and every http request get 30 more item , we better create variable named \"visibleThreshold\"  this variable will be used to check if we reach end of the list ,if we are close the end of the list we will do another http request ( or what you wanna do ). Lets say it is 3 , when we reach last 3 of the item from end of the list we will automatically make another request to get 30 item more and notify adapter that new items will show up.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270020.js?file=gistfile1.txt\"></script>\n\n<p>previousTotal hold the total item in the list previously and loading is a boolean value to check if at that moment we are loading data from network. Now lets see onScroll method how to implement endless scroll effect.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270025.js?file=gistfile1.java\"></script>\n\n<p>Here the main logic that implements endless scroll effect in the list , i often do this job in the AsyncTask\'s doinBackground method and to warn the user i show a little pop up informing that more data is on the way. Here is the dialog code.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270027.js?file=gistfile1.java\"></script>\n\n<p>Lets say we do all the networking in AsynchTask actually this is best practice to do the network or similar jobs at background i am not go into details of the AsynchTask right now but i will give the generic code to complete subject.</p>\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270028.js?file=gistfile1.java\"></script>\n\n<p>AsynchTask is very easy comparing to other Thread environments just do the preparing stuff in onPreExecute , do the main job and doInBackground method , after thread is completed do what you wanna do at onPostExecute. Check the code above for better understanding. But important thing to consider you can not change main thread(which draw the main interface widgets) from background thread above onPreExecute and onPostExecute are main thread methods except doInBackground its a background thread method so \"do not change interface from background thread\".</p>','2011-10-07 10:54:04','2011-10-07 10:54:04'),(15,1,'remove-underline-from-links-in-textview','REMOVE UNDERLINE FROM LINKS IN TEXTVIEW','I have mention about linkifying text in android textview widget , you can go check it again its here.

Of course you can turn actual web links to web urls thats not to hard but what if you have pattern in your text you wanna make link and also these links call another activity in your application instead of web browser as normal web links do. First lets dig into how to transform your text into actual web urls in the text and linkify them , actually thats easy you get the text which android can search for web urls and just linkify them here is a code that will do the job for you.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270055.js?file=link.java\"></script>\r\n\r\nWe are getting the textview object and than creating links according to parameters given to linkify in this case Linkify.WEB_URLS which means that any string that matches with the url pattern. Then i set the link color of the text with preferred one this time with #FFF hex color. Now as a next step lets turn any phone number into actual phone number link so that when user click these phone number links they can call these numbers. Here is a sample code for this.\r\n\r\n<script src=\"https://gist.github.com/1270062.js?file=phone.java\"></script>\r\n\r\nNow when user click one of the phone links phone try to call these numbers automatically.

But how about a text that include a pattern you wanna linkify , how can you achieve this ? Lets say you are developing a twitter client application and you wanna linkify @username field in the twit text and you wanna call your app activity when user click these links. This could be hard ata first look. But it is not as hard as you think . If you have a little experience on regular expression this makes your life easier in this situation or similar ones.

Lets cut to the chase, I was busy with my summer school taking courses (Signal&amp;Systems, Engineering Management etc) and rest of the time I try to hack new things mostly. For about almost 2-3 weeks I try to implement my own project that I developed for android that had some unfinished business. Than I got request from one of gsm companies to implement application for their brand. I almost finished developing application that I can say my progress about %90 right now. I got some design and code review things to do with project other than that I am done with it for a while.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>I try to grasp deep knowladge about python world cause I have both stand alone and web projects that waiting to be implemented with python. I started for a while with <a href=\"http://zedshaw.com/\">Zed Shaw\'s </a><a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\">Learn Python The Hard Way</a> book then move on to Mark Lutz <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Powerful-Object-Oriented-Programming/dp/0596158068/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312924935&amp;sr=1-1\">Learning Python</a>. I can recommend Zed\'s book for new starters its a good book mostly direct you to self learning and searching. Mark Lutz book is more elaborate and detailed&nbsp;on this topic providing really deep theoretical knowladge for about 200 pages, some people dont like this they want to directly jump into hello world =&gt; syntax =&gt; expressions =&gt; data structures and goes like that. I was reading the latest version of Mark\'s book which covers Python 3.0 not common use right now but will be in the future and you can learn whats new with that version. Because there are not so much projects using Python 3.0 in order to really understand changes with versions I am still reading Python 2.5 version of the book which you can find <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-3rd-Mark-Lutz/dp/0596513984/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312924935&amp;sr=1-2\">here</a>. I forgot to mention but \"A byte of python\" is another great book that probably you can finish for about 1-2 hour its free also you can get it from <a href=\"http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python\">here</a>. And how about Python ? Well for short python is a language that designed for readability first in mind so code you have written looks very structured and thats one thing I wanna see in a language IMHO. Coming from Java background thats one thing I miss for a while (i think somebody said inner class, oh my). Other thing I like about Python that philosophy \"<em>Explicit is better than implicit</em>\". Yes you exactly see whats going on when you do things in Python I think this is one the things that differs Python from Ruby which allows you to do things \"magically\". You can get more of this from <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\">Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;or by \"import this\". I will write more about Python and things interesting about design of it and comparison with languages I know.

For about almost 2-3 weeks I try to implement my own project that I developed for android that had some unfinished business. Than I got request from one of gsm companies to implement application for their brand. I almost finished developing application that I can say my progress about %90 right now. I got some design and code review things to do with project other than that I am done with it for a while.</p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>I try to grasp deep knowladge about python world cause I have both stand alone and web projects that waiting to be implemented with python. I started for a while with <a href=\"http://zedshaw.com/\">Zed Shaw\'s </a><a href=\"http://learnpythonthehardway.org/\">Learn Python The Hard Way</a> book then move on to Mark Lutz <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-Powerful-Object-Oriented-Programming/dp/0596158068/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312924935&amp;sr=1-1\">Learning Python</a>. I can recommend Zed\'s book for new starters its a good book mostly direct you to self learning and searching. Mark Lutz book is more elaborate and detailed&nbsp;on this topic providing really deep theoretical knowladge for about 200 pages, some people dont like this they want to directly jump into hello world =&gt; syntax =&gt; expressions =&gt; data structures and goes like that. I was reading the latest version of Mark\'s book which covers Python 3.0 not common use right now but will be in the future and you can learn whats new with that version. Because there are not so much projects using Python 3.0 in order to really understand changes with versions I am still reading Python 2.5 version of the book which you can find <a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Learning-Python-3rd-Mark-Lutz/dp/0596513984/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1312924935&amp;sr=1-2\">here</a>. I forgot to mention but \"A byte of python\" is another great book that probably you can finish for about 1-2 hour its free also you can get it from <a href=\"http://www.swaroopch.com/notes/Python\">here</a>. And how about Python ? Well for short python is a language that designed for readability first in mind so code you have written looks very structured and thats one thing I wanna see in a language IMHO. Coming from Java background thats one thing I miss for a while (i think somebody said inner class, oh my). Other thing I like about Python that philosophy \"<em>Explicit is better than implicit</em>\". Yes you exactly see whats going on when you do things in Python I think this is one the things that differs Python from Ruby which allows you to do things \"magically\". You can get more of this from <a href=\"http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0020/\">Zen of Python</a>&nbsp;or by \"import this\". I will write more about Python and things interesting about design of it and comparison with languages I know.

How come ? The actual journey started about 7 months ago while i was at the beginning of the 4th grade that I informed by Microsoft Recruiter with mail stating that they are interested in me for their full time positions at Redmond. Yes it was exciting news for me , that was one my dreams to work at Redmond from the moment I started my first grade at Computer Science. But there are some stages you have to pass or impress them or convince them that you are good enough to come to the one on one interview.  Let me tell you about how the hole interview process goes at Microsoft. First they got my resume which have to be good and professional enough so that they can contact with me for their open positions. Lets assume you have impressed them and passed this stage next thing you see in your inbox stating that \"hi we are from Microsoft and i am recruiter, we are impressed by your works and resume and we would like to conduct a phone interview with you\" kind of thing and you get excited more , then both decide a good interview day and time considering your local time, you can change interview day and time if the given ones does not fit with your calendar (but it must be reasonable excuse), i delay the interview about 2 times i think. And the interview day you are waiting front of the phone staring with empty eyes to phone, you are excited and phone rang with unknown number, &nbsp;oh bummer! you both experiencing problem with getting voice from the other side. Recruiter suggested to delay the interview to another day and after some more mailing between you and recruiter both decide to do this over Skype. You find a good internet connection and about 10 minutes before the interview time recruiter add you from Skype and interview begins. Recruiter tells you how the phone interview process works and said it last about 45 minutes. After introduction phase recruiter start asking some general questions, i will give some of the questions here that i have&nbsp; been asked</p>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Which position you are applying for ? (SDE/SDET)</li>\r\n<li>Why are you applying to this position ?</li>\r\n<li>How would you describe the good code ?</li>\r\n<li>What is the most compelling project you did and describe it and your job in project? (if its a team work more explanation)</li>\r\n<li>Why do you wanna work at Microsoft ? (you didnt expect this coming did you ? :) )</li>\r\n<li>What is ideal programmer look like grade yourself if ideal one is 10 ?</li>\r\n<li>Ok lets consider you have 1 month free at Microsoft after starting to work here, what do you wanna work on (technology, project) ?</li>\r\n<li>Assume we are shipping Xbox, you are the last person before shipping to test it , how would you test it ?</li>\r\n</ul>\r\n<p>These are some of the general question i have been asked and i try to do my best to answer these questions and of &nbsp;course after these questions i have been asked technical questions, i am not gonna give that questions you can search and find similar tricky questions at all most all over the internet. But if i level the difficulties of the technical questions i can say they were between medium and hard.  And you looked at your time 45 minutes is over and recruiter say some procedural stuff stating that we will get back to you even if results are positive or negative within two weeks. You hang up the phone and you feel relief. After two weeks recruiter returns me with positive feedback and stated that \"we want to meet you and we will provide second interview location as soon as possible\". Again you send lots of email for visa,passport, location etc. As a result they decided on interviewing with me at Poland instead of Redmond. Because travelling from Turkey to Redmond-US would be exhausting for me they decide on Poland. I will now skip the other boring parts and continue with the how did i fail part.</p>\r\n<h2>You have to prepare well...</h2>\r\n<p>I could not prepare well for the interview cause I have projects on going, I&nbsp;was working at that time at <a href=\"http://www.turkcelltech.com/Default.aspx\">Turkcell Technology</a> on the other side I&nbsp;have classes at university and their midterm and projects, I participated in some mobile competitions get some good&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.aveainovasyoncagrisi.com/blog/\">degree</a>s etc etc. This is one of the biggest reasons of my failure.</p>\r\n<h2>You have to know data structures, their complexity and trade-offs well...</h2>\r\n<p>I knew the data structures well, I was really practiced them at my projects especially the hard ones at university with C/C++. But after a while i move my primary language to Java, things started to change now my projects doesnt need a algorithmic thinking or some kind of data structure, \"oh we need a binary search, oh great java already have one lets use it no need to code it again\", if you do this about 2 year repeatedly you start to lose your&nbsp;competency about data structures and algorithms like which one is suitable for which situation, what is their complexity,what is their trade-off, which algorithm we should use and how to implement it. And then I realized the projects I involved or I created recently that can be easily done without any core CS education and they are not really showing my differences from a self thought programmer who doesnt have CS education. I am not saying the projects i have done were not good ones, they are good and innovative but most of them does not involve any context that i can use my CS knowledge. I think this is one of the main problem that students suffer in Turkey. I got a good education at university I have to show what makes me exceptional with my core CS knowledge, without using that knowledge I am just useless. This is second biggest reason of my failure.  I face with data structures and complexity question with my second interviewer. He is one of the <a href=\"http://www.microsoft.com/windowsphone/en-us/default.aspx\">Windows Phone 7</a> service developers at Redmond, he asked me to code some specific problems about link lists, searching algorithms and other data structures. I was again asked for some testing questions with given client-server architecture about how to testing and breaking it. I was not expecting but i was asked also some brain teaser questions, after some thinking time and with the suggestion of \"think outside of the box\" from him i can come up with answer.</p>\r\n<h2>You have to practice white board coding also know types of testing ( blackbox, whitebox )...</h2>\r\n<p>One of the things that I&nbsp;havent really practiced. <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2004/04/15/114094.aspx\">This post</a> give a good grasp about white board coding written by one of Microsoft &nbsp;SDE ,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing\">Blackbox</a> testing, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitebox_testing\">whitebox</a> testing, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing\">regression</a> testing, positive test cases, negative test cases.</p>\r\n<h2>You have to good at code reading and finding bugs in given time</h2>\r\n<p>Other than asking questions they gave me some code that i should find if any bugs appear in it. Also you have to do some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing\">blackbox testing</a> on given function or module. Provide them some negative test cases or some positive test cases for the code. Until i got to interview i didnt realize that i couldnt developed myself at testing area of the software development but this was not totally my fault there are not classes at university talking about testing in a detailed way not just \"this is unit testing you test individual components of the code for use , this is integration testing you group the software parts of modules and test as a group, thats how testing done\" like giving detailed information about how blackbox testing done, how whitebox testing done and may be a project that students try to write a code that try to break the working one. I dont know these are just random thoughts come to my mind. You can say that testing does not have to be learned at university you can learn on your own or at work sadly i did not write too much test while i was working and didnt aim that software topic too but i wouldnt hurt someone to have this kind of classes at least as technical elective ( i am not even sure if any university in Turkey providing this kind of classes).  I talked about testing and how its done at Microsoft with my first interviewer he was a old Win 95 developer which started as a SDE then move to SDET position, he was one of the testters of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType\">TTF (TrueTypeFonts)</a> at Windows but now he was one the tester of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_language_runtime\">.NET CLR (Common Language Runtime)</a> . I asked him lots of questions about transitions from SDE to SDET position cause even SDET\'s at Microsoft write much more code than SDE\'s purposes of the positions are different. I was not satisfied by his answers cause seems like this transition was not his choice but he answered my question very informative way including how testing done at Microsoft.</p>\r\n<h2>You have to read at least 5-6 of these books...</h2>\r\n<ul>\r\n<li>Box, Don.&nbsp;<em>Essential .Net, Volume I: The Common Language Runtime</em>.

Overall of above reasons i couldnt pass the bar so i didnt got an offer.</p>\r\n<h2>Not all of the interview process pointless if result negative...</h2>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>These headings with bold are also valid for interviews of other world wide tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook. From this post you can say that my interview went very bad and i couldnt answer even single question but its not like that. I answer almost all questions that they have asked to me but what prevent me from getting offer is that for every question they asked they raise the bar and want me to improve previous version of code (i am talking about complexity or general term more efficient way to do same job), if you havent practiced or not well prepared to this you will probably will fail too. I know result not good but there are some beneficial effects of this interview and the hole process. I got a really good interview experience really good one, see my weaknesses, achieve one of my dream (even getting to interview for full-time position at 4th grade is a satisfaction for me, not too much people got this chance ), had a chance to see Poland-Warsaw great city by the way. This does not mean that everything over, who knows maybe i will apply again... ;)</p>','<h2>Story Part</h2>\n\n<p><img src=\"/static/images/uploads/microsoft1.jpg\" align=\"left\" /></p>\n\n<p>Yes I try to join the dark side but i failed :).

I was not expecting but i was asked also some brain teaser questions, after some thinking time and with the suggestion of \"think outside of the box\" from him i can come up with answer.</p>\n\n<h2>You have to practice white board coding also know types of testing ( blackbox, whitebox )...</h2>\n\n<p>One of the things that I&nbsp;havent really practiced. <a href=\"http://blogs.msdn.com/b/ericlippert/archive/2004/04/15/114094.aspx\">This post</a> give a good grasp about white board coding written by one of Microsoft &nbsp;SDE ,<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing\">Blackbox</a> testing, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whitebox_testing\">whitebox</a> testing, <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regression_testing\">regression</a> testing, positive test cases, negative test cases.</p>\n\n<h2>You have to good at code reading and finding bugs in given time</h2>\n\n<p>Other than asking questions they gave me some code that i should find if any bugs appear in it. Also you have to do some <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black-box_testing\">blackbox testing</a> on given function or module. Provide them some negative test cases or some positive test cases for the code. Until i got to interview i didnt realize that i couldnt developed myself at testing area of the software development but this was not totally my fault there are not classes at university talking about testing in a detailed way not just \"this is unit testing you test individual components of the code for use , this is integration testing you group the software parts of modules and test as a group, thats how testing done\" like giving detailed information about how blackbox testing done, how whitebox testing done and may be a project that students try to write a code that try to break the working one. I dont know these are just random thoughts come to my mind. You can say that testing does not have to be learned at university you can learn on your own or at work sadly i did not write too much test while i was working and didnt aim that software topic too but i wouldnt hurt someone to have this kind of classes at least as technical elective ( i am not even sure if any university in Turkey providing this kind of classes).  I talked about testing and how its done at Microsoft with my first interviewer he was a old Win 95 developer which started as a SDE then move to SDET position, he was one of the testters of the&nbsp;<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TrueType\">TTF (TrueTypeFonts)</a> at Windows but now he was one the tester of <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_language_runtime\">.NET CLR (Common Language Runtime)</a> . I asked him lots of questions about transitions from SDE to SDET position cause even SDET\'s at Microsoft write much more code than SDE\'s purposes of the positions are different. I was not satisfied by his answers cause seems like this transition was not his choice but he answered my question very informative way including how testing done at Microsoft.</p>\n\n<h2>You have to read at least 5-6 of these books...</h2>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Box, Don.&nbsp;<em>Essential .Net, Volume I: The Common Language Runtime</em>.

Overall of above reasons i couldnt pass the bar so i didnt got an offer.</p>\n\n<h2>Not all of the interview process pointless if result negative...</h2>\n\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n\n<p>These headings with bold are also valid for interviews of other world wide tech companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook. From this post you can say that my interview went very bad and i couldnt answer even single question but its not like that. I answer almost all questions that they have asked to me but what prevent me from getting offer is that for every question they asked they raise the bar and want me to improve previous version of code (i am talking about complexity or general term more efficient way to do same job), if you havent practiced or not well prepared to this you will probably will fail too. I know result not good but there are some beneficial effects of this interview and the hole process. I got a really good interview experience really good one, see my weaknesses, achieve one of my dream (even getting to interview for full-time position at 4th grade is a satisfaction for me, not too much people got this chance ), had a chance to see Poland-Warsaw great city by the way. This does not mean that everything over, who knows maybe i will apply again... ;)</p>','2011-10-07 11:16:47','2011-10-07 11:21:25');
